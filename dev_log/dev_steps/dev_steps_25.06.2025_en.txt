## Development Stages

### Stage 1: Session Initialization
- **Time**: 25.06.2025 10:11:03
- **Action**: Creating new development log files for today
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Notes**: Ensuring proper documentation and timestamp tracking

### Stage 2: Adding Server Creation, Confirmation Popup, and No PHP/DB Options
- **Time**: 25.06.2025
- **Action**: Adding "Create Server" button at the bottom of the server characteristics selection popup.
- **Details**:
  - Clicking the button shows a confirmation popup with the text "Are you sure you want to create the server?" and two buttons: "Yes" (normal) and "No" (red border).
  - Clicking "No" closes the popup and returns to server characteristics selection.
  - Clicking "Yes" sends the parameters for server creation (skeleton ready, need to complete API call), and all popups close and return to the servers list page.
  - Added "Do not install PHP" option to PHP dropdown.
  - Added "None (do not install a database)" option to database dropdown.
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Notes**: Need to complete actual API call implementation to Ploi in the next stage.

PROMPT: "Let's add logging now to track exactly what happens. Run the log when clicking 'Create Server'. Check why after clicking create server - no server is actually created."

----------------------------------------
✨ What I did this session:
----------------------------------------
- Added detailed logs (debugPrint) for server creation and server refresh operations, including every step in the process.
- Fixed all flutter analyze warnings (avoid_print, use_build_context_synchronously) – using debugPrint and checking mounted before using context.
- Updated instruction files so that documentation in development logs is automatically mandatory for every change, without requiring user approval.

----------------------------------------
🔧 Main technical changes:
----------------------------------------
- Updated file: lib/main.dart (added debugPrint, mounted check, context handling)
- Updated instruction files: README_INSTRUCTIONS.md, DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW_INSTRUCTIONS.md (mandatory automatic documentation)

----------------------------------------
🎯 Results:
----------------------------------------
✅ Detailed logs available in console for every critical operation
✅ No flutter analyze warnings
✅ Automatic documentation built into the process

----------------------------------------
📋 Next steps:
----------------------------------------
- Check the logs in practice when running server creation
- Continue developing server management features

----------------------------------------
🎉 Session achievements:
----------------------------------------
- Significant improvement in debugging capabilities
- Consistent and mandatory documentation process for every change

## Session End Notes
- Next session planning
- Remaining tasks
- Issues to address

# Important instructions for running commands and cleaning project in PowerShell
- Do not use && for command chaining in PowerShell (run each command separately).
- Ensure commands are executed from the project directory (Projects/ploi_api_app).
- If there are permission errors or locked files (e.g., build, .dart_tool), close all Flutter/browser processes and delete directories manually or with separate command.
- Always document any issues/errors and ensure resolution before continuing work.

## Example of correct commands:
```
cd ../ploi_api_app
rmdir /s /q build
rmdir /s /q .dart_tool
flutter clean
flutter run -d chrome
```
---

# Instruction: Document changes in dev log
- Every code, UI, or process change – requires immediate update of step files (dev log) in Hebrew and English, before moving to the next task.
- Do not wait for user reminder – documentation is an integral part of the flow.
- Ensure detailed, accurate documentation with date and time.

### Stage 3: Attempting to Run on Windows - Developer Mode and Visual Studio Requirements
- **Time**: 25.06.2025
- **Action**: Attempting to run Flutter application on Windows platform.
- **Details**:
  - Successful navigation to ploi_api_app directory
  - Running flutter doctor - confirming Flutter installation (Channel stable, 3.32.4)
  - Successfully performing flutter clean and flutter pub get
  - Attempting flutter run -d windows
  - Identifying two critical issues:
    1. Developer Mode required for symlink support
    2. Missing Visual Studio toolchain for Windows compilation
- **Status**: ⚠️ Blocked - requires system settings
- **Notes**: Need to enable Developer Mode and install Visual Studio with C++ development tools for desktop.
