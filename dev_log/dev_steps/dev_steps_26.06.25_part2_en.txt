✨ What I Did This Session:
----------------------------------------

1. **Accurate Time Check:**
   - Checked time against timeanddate.com
   - Current time: Thursday, June 26, 2025, 19:58 IDT (UTC+3)

2. **Read Development Instructions:**
   - Read README_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   - Read DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   - Understood strict documentation requirements

3. **Created clean_ploi.bat:**
   - Comprehensive batch file for cleaning and rebuilding
   - Includes 5 main steps:
     * Navigate to project directory
     * flutter clean
     * Manual deletion of build directory
     * flutter pub get
     * flutter build windows --debug
   - Includes error handling and clear messages
   - Emojis and user-friendly interface

4. **Created run_ploi.bat:**
   - Batch file for running the application on Windows
   - Includes 3 main steps:
     * Navigate to project directory
     * Check if application is built
     * Launch the application
   - Automatic building if executable doesn't exist
   - Uses start "" for opening in separate window

----------------------------------------
🔧 Major Technical Changes:
----------------------------------------

**Files Created:**
1. `Projects/ploi_api_app/clean_ploi.bat` - Cleaning and rebuilding file
2. `Projects/ploi_api_app/run_ploi.bat` - Application launcher file

**clean_ploi.bat Features:**
- Automatic navigation to project directory
- flutter clean with error handling
- rmdir /s /q "build" for manual build deletion
- flutter pub get for dependency updates
- flutter build windows --debug for new build
- Clear messages with emojis
- pause at end for reading messages

**run_ploi.bat Features:**
- Automatic navigation to project directory
- Check if executable file exists
- Automatic building if required
- Launch with start "" "build\windows\x64\runner\Debug\ploi_api_app.exe"
- Clear messages and process tracking
- pause >nul for convenient closing

----------------------------------------
🎯 Results:
----------------------------------------

✅ What Works:
- Created two functional batch files
- clean_ploi.bat performs complete cleaning and building process
- run_ploi.bat launches the application on Windows
- All files include advanced error handling
- User-friendly interface with clear messages

🔄 What's In Progress:
- Files are ready for testing
- Need to verify they work as expected

❌ What Doesn't Work:
- Not yet tested in practice (just created)

----------------------------------------
📋 Next Steps:
----------------------------------------

1. **Test the Files:**
   - Run clean_ploi.bat for testing
   - Run run_ploi.bat for testing
   - Ensure processes work as expected

2. **Documentation Update:**
   - Update bug_log.md if issues arise
   - Update README if needed

3. **Git Workflow:**
   - Commit changes with proper message

📝 Technical Notes:
----------------------------------------

**File Design:**
- Each file starts with @echo off for clean interface
- Headers with == for clear identification
- Automatic date and time with %date% %time%
- Use cd /d for safe navigation between drives
- Error handling with if %errorlevel% neq 0
- pause and pause >nul for good user experience

**Safety:**

- Failure handling with exit /b 1
- Clear warning messages
- Backup and cleanup before new build

**Usability:**
- Emojis for quick status identification
- Clear Hebrew messages
- Numbered steps
- User tips in case of problems
