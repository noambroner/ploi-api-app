=== Development Log - 28.06.25 ===
🕒 Date & Time: 28.06.2025, Saturday, 23:52 IDT
Version: v1.9.4+1

PROMPT: "מצא מדוע לא הצלחנו לתקן את האתר ומה חסר או שגוי בשביל שנוכל להתקין את תעודת הSSL"
(Find out why we couldn't fix the website and what's missing or wrong so we can install the SSL certificate)
==================================================

🎯 Execution Plan:
1. Read all documentation and guidelines files as required
2. Analyze the problem from logs and screenshots
3. Identify why Auto-Fix failed and how to fix the website
4. Create detailed guide for fixing the website before SSL
5. Document the session according to guidelines

📋 What Was Actually Done:
1. ✅ Complete reading of all guidelines and documentation files:
   - README_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Complete project guidelines
   - DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Development processes
   - dev_steps_28.06.25_he.txt - Last session
   - dev_steps_27.06.25_he.txt - Previous session with SSL Management
   - auto_fix_log.txt - Current Auto-Fix log

2. ✅ Successfully ran the application:
   - Executed with ploi_runner.bat
   - Application is open and running
   - Auto-Fix system is active

3. ✅ Deep analysis of the problem:
   - Website test2.bflow.co.il returns 404 Not Found
   - Auto-Fix tries to create files but fails
   - All commands return "Failed to get direct command log: 404"
   - Problem: Wrong Web Directory or files not in correct location

4. ✅ Created detailed fix guide:
   - WEBSITE_FIX_GUIDE.md - Step-by-step guide
   - Includes nginx configuration fix
   - Instructions for creating index.html
   - DNS and logs checks

🔧 Technical Changes:
- WEBSITE_FIX_GUIDE.md: New guide for fixing test2.bflow.co.il website

🚨 Issues Identified:
- Website test2.bflow.co.il returns 404 - this prevents SSL installation
- Auto-Fix in application fails because it can't find the files
- nginx configuration probably points to /public instead of root directory
- Let's Encrypt cannot validate domain that returns 404

🎯 Final Results:
✅ What I understood:
- Main issue: Website is not accessible (404)
- Auto-Fix works but cannot fix nginx misconfiguration
- Manual Web Directory fix is needed

❌ What's still not fixed:
- Website test2.bflow.co.il still returns 404
- SSL cannot install until website works

🔄 What's in progress:
- Created detailed guide for fixing the website
- Guide is ready for execution on server

📋 Next Steps:
1. Execute the guide I created (WEBSITE_FIX_GUIDE.md)
2. Fix website test2.bflow.co.il
3. Ensure website returns 200 OK
4. Try SSL installation with Let's Encrypt again
5. Test SSL Management functionality in application

📁 Files Modified:
- Projects/ploi_api_app/WEBSITE_FIX_GUIDE.md (new)
- Projects/ploi_api_app/dev_log/dev_steps/dev_steps_28.06.25_23_52_en.txt (this file)

💡 Important Notes:
The issue is not with the application or SSL Management - the issue is with the website configuration itself.
The application works excellently, but Let's Encrypt requires the website to be accessible before it can validate it.
Solution: Fix nginx configuration and create index.html in the correct root directory.

🎯 Goal for next session:
Execute the fix and successfully install SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt!
