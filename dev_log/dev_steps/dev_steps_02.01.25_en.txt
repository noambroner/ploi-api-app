🔍 Key Technical Improvements:

**Detailed Logging:**
```dart
print('🔐 SSL Certificate Installation Request:');
print('  Server ID: $serverId');
print('  Site ID: $siteId');
print('  Certificate: $certificate');
print('  Type: $type');
```

**Smart Domain Handling:**
```dart
String certificateValue;
if (_certificateType == 'letsencrypt') {
  certificateValue = domains.first; // First domain only
} else {
  certificateValue = domains.join(','); // All domains
}
```

**API Connection Test:**
```dart
await ploiService.testConnection();
```

**Detailed Error Dialog:**
- Display full error message
- Practical solution suggestions
- Clear and user-friendly design

🎯 Next Steps (for next session):
