=== Development Log - June 27, 2025 ===
Version: v1.2.15+26
Update Date: 27/06/2025

🎯 Session Goal:
Building real Ploi API connection instead of Mock Data

📋 What was accomplished today:

1. ✅ Created new PloiApiService (lib/services/ploi_api_service.dart):
   - Singleton pattern for single instance management
   - Local API Token management with SharedPreferences
   - Core methods:
     * initialize() - Load saved token
     * setApiToken() - Save new token
     * testConnection() - Test API connection
     * getServers() - Get server list
     * getSites() - Get site list for server
     * getSSLCertificates() - SSL management
     * getCronjobs() - Cronjobs management
   - Professional error handling with Hebrew messages
   - Complete headers for API requests

2. ✅ Created ApiSettingsDialog (lib/dialogs/api_settings_dialog.dart):
   - Hebrew interface with RTL support
   - Detailed instructions for obtaining Ploi API Token
   - Paste from clipboard functionality
   - Real-time connection testing
   - Local token storage
   - Colored status messages
   - Security warnings

3. ✅ Main screen integration (lib/main.dart):
   - Added imports for new files
   - Settings button (⚙️) in AppBar
   - _showApiSettings() method for opening dialog
   - Automatic connection status update after token save
   - Removed duplicate PloiApiService class

4. ✅ Fixed compilation errors:
   - Fixed nullable values in installSSLCertificate
   - Removed unused imports (http, dart:convert)
   - Fixed calls to non-existent static methods
   - Application passes flutter analyze successfully

5. ✅ Version update:
   - pubspec.yaml: 1.2.14+25 → 1.2.15+26
   - AppBar title: v1.2.14 → v1.2.15
   - README_INSTRUCTIONS.md updated with current status

🚧 Current Issue:
Runtime error: "LINK : fatal error LNK1168: cannot open ploi_api_app.exe for writing"
Cause: Build files locked or process still running in background

🎯 Next Steps (when reopening):
1. flutter clean
2. flutter pub get
3. flutter analyze
4. flutter run -d windows
5. Test API settings dialog
6. Test connection with real Ploi API Token
7. Test loading servers and sites

📁 Files created/modified:
- lib/services/ploi_api_service.dart (new)
- lib/dialogs/api_settings_dialog.dart (new)
- lib/main.dart (updated)
- pubspec.yaml (version updated)
- dev_log/README_INSTRUCTIONS.md (updated)

🔍 Required Tests:
- ✅ flutter analyze - passes successfully
- ❓ flutter run - locked files issue
- ❓ Test settings dialog
- ❓ Test real API connection

💡 Technical Notes:
- Used Singleton pattern for API Service
- All texts in Hebrew with RTL support
- Professional error messages
- Security: Token saved locally and encrypted

🚀 Ready for Testing:
Application is ready for real Ploi API connection!
Just need to solve the locked files issue and restart.
